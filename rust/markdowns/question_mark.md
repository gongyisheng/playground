code:
```rust
op.write("test", "Hello, World!").await?;
```
Q: 
```
What does the question mark do in the above code?
```

A: 
```
.await?: This is where the question mark comes into play. In Rust, when you use the await keyword in an asynchronous context, you are essentially telling the program to pause the execution of the current async function until the awaited operation is complete.

The ? following await is used for error handling. It's a shorthand way of handling the Result type that is typically returned from asynchronous functions. When the awaited operation completes successfully, the value is unwrapped from the Result, and the program continues as usual. However, if the Result represents an error (e.g., an I/O error, network failure, etc.), the ? will immediately return from the current function with the error, effectively propagating it up the call stack.

In other words, the ? is used to handle errors without explicitly writing out a lengthy series of match or Result combinators. Instead, it short-circuits the function and returns the error if one is encountered, otherwise unwraps the successful result.
