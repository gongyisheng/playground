// "abc": This is a string literal, which is a fixed-size sequence of characters. 
// String literals are stored in the program's binary and have a static lifetime. 
// They are usually used for short, known strings that don't need to be mutated.

// String::from("abc"): This creates a String type instance by dynamically allocating 
// memory on the heap to store the string content. String is a dynamically resizable, 
// heap-allocated string type that can be modified and grown.
