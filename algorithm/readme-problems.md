[LC145](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/) basic postorder  
[LC589](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal) basic preorder, n-ray  
[LC590](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/) basic postorder, n-ray  
[LC429](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-level-order-traversal/) basic levelorder, n-ray   
[LC1302](https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum) traverse + status collect, find max  
[LC987](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree) traverse + status collect, sort result  
[LC113](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii) preorder dfs + status collect  
[LC98](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree) inorder dfs + status collect, check trend  
[LC100](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/) traverse + status passing  
[LC101](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree) traverse + status passing, almost same as LC100  
[LC572](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree) traverse + status passing, similar to LC100  
[LC104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) traverse + status passing, max depth  
[LC110](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree) traverse + status passing, depth + judgement logic  
[LC111](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree) traverse + status passing, depth + judgement logic  
[LC235](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree) traverse + status passing, return lca, use the property of BST  
[LC236](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree) traverse + status passing, return lca, compare it with LC235, trick is finding the way to pass status  
[LC1123](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves) traverse + status passing, return ans_node and depth at the same time, compare with LC235 and LC236  

## BST
[LC98](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree) inorder + check trend

## DFS/BFS
[LC55](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game) dfs/bfs --> state compress, greedy  
[LC79](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search) typical grid dfs, tricks: a. do all validation before exploring b. change path value to # to mark it's visited.  
[LC117](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii) bfs, level order  
[LC130](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions) dfs, avoid methods that may cause wrong updates (should update only if all return true, but make updates before get result and cannot rollback).  
[LC1863](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals) dfs to traverse all subset, add xor sum  
[LC2039](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-time-when-the-network-becomes-idle/) bfs, tricks: a. just do bfs one time from master to get the dist to every node. b. build model of calculating idle time, additional msg cnt * patience + dst + 1. c. be careful to calculate additional msg cnt.  

## Binary Search

## Sort
[LC3169](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-days-without-meetings) sort + state compression, count segment  
[LC3394](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-grid-can-be-cut-into-sections) sort + count segment * 2 times  
[LC2003](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid) sort + medium, why medium? think about a group of dots on a line and you need to choose one point that sum of distance of all dots to that point is smallest. The point should be average (which is not possible in this problem) or medium  

## Heap
[LC215](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array) mini heap, push then pop  
[LC1054](https://leetcode.com/problems/distant-barcodes) heap, pick most frequent first  

## Sliding Window
[LC2379](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks) dfs? no, use sliding window  

## Divide and Conquer
[LC23](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists) merge and sort, be careful is len(lists) == 0  

## Graph
[LC1976](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-arrive-at-destination) dfs/bfs? no, use dijkstra(find shortest route) + dp (count ways)  
[LC839](https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-string-groups) string comparison + union-find  
[LC3108](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-walk-in-weighted-graph) bit operations + union-find (note: -1&anything = anything, the more number you have, the less & sum you can get)  


## Dynamic Programing
[LC2140](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower) reverse order dp, ascending order does not work  


## Uncategorized
[LC82](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii) while+while   
[LC201](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range) observation, common suffix + bit observation  
[LC2873](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-an-ordered-triplet-i) 3 loop is fine, but can be done with one loop by recording max value, max diff, and max result  
[LC310](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees) mht, cut leaves. 2 ways to get medium of a list: by index or cut leafs recursively
