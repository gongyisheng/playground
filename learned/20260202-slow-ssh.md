Slow ssh login issue

root cause: non-exist disk UUID in /etc/fstab

debug process (with openclaw)
1. Timed SSH with -vvv — auth completed in ~1 second, so the delay wasn't in the tunnel or key exchange
2. Ruled out the usual suspects — DNS lookups, MOTD scripts, bashrc — all fast
3. Noticed pam_systemd.so in PAM config — this creates a systemd user session on login
4. Checked /var/log/auth.log — saw the smoking gun:systemd: home.mount: Job failed with 'dependency'
5. Checked systemctl status home.mount — it was trying to mount /home from a UUID
6. Ran blkid — those UUIDs don't exist → 90s timeout waiting for phantom disks
The 90 seconds is systemd's default mount timeout. Classic case of leftover config from when the machine had different storage attached.

fix by:
```
sudo vim /etc/fstab

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
