following code will go into deadlock if mysql connection pool size=1:  
```
item_iter = mysql_client._select_table_iter(sql)
async for item in item_iter:
    sift_user = await mysql_client._select_table_one(sql)
```
iterator and async/await _select_table requires at least two connection to continue the loop  
If there's only one connection, it will go into deadlock.
