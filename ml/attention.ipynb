    "# Q: Why softmax?\n",
    "# A: Softmax is used to convert the attention scores into a probability distribution.\n",
    "#    It makes all outputs sum to 1 and each output is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "#    This is perfect for attention weights because We want to know \"how much attention\" (proportion) to pay to each position.\n",
