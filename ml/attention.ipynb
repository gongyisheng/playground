    "\n",

    "# A: Divide by np.sqrt(self.d_k): avoid large values in dot products which lead to small gradients in softmax\n",

    "# Q: Why divide by np.sqrt(self.d_k), not self.d_k or self.d_k^2?\n",
    "# A: mathematical explanation: assume Q and K are random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, \n",

    "#    so we divide by np.sqrt(self.d_k) to normalize the variance to 1 again\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q: Why softmax?\n",
    "# A: Softmax is used to convert the attention scores into a probability distribution.\n",
    "#    It makes all outputs sum to 1 and each output is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "#    This is perfect for attention weights because We want to know \"how much attention\" (proportion) to pay to each position.\n",
    "#    Sigmoid not used because output sum != 1.\n",
    "#    ReLU not used because it does not normalize outputs and create a probability distribution.\n",
